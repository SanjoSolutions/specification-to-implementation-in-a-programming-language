# Concepts

* printing
* input
* program
* run
* outputs

# Mappings

* input -> process.argv[2]
* outputs -> console.log
* run -> the function which is executed when starting the program

# Implementation

* When there is a more general solution available which passes all specification, then prefer the more general solution.
* Because a symbol is used that comes from another module, the symbol is imported from the module.

* Mappings from terms to concepts.

* Nouns might refer to classes of things.
* Verbs might refer to processes.
